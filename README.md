# CollectionViewApp
A simple iOS App to show collectionView
UICollectionView -  ia a collection of items, Where each item is a cell. A cell is a container of view. A cell can contain any userInterface. A cell UI includes buttons, labels, textfield, images , etc.
Certain things need to be kept in mind while considering a collectionView : 
1. We need to decide how many sections we need to divide the items in?
2. How many items we need in each section of our collectionView?
3. Where are the data of the items stored ? Eg : An array
4. How does the item look like ? The UI of the cell.
5. By Default Scrolling in a collectionView is vertical, if you want horizontal scroll,then specially change it in the xcode property section of the collectionview from vertical -> horizontal.
